#About

FactoidTracker is a way to track tid bits of information about a subject. I first started creating this app while I was working at a software company as a QA Engineer. The company had a very large rails application with a large code base. As a member of QA, there were many things that I had to remember to test when working in certain areas of the code. This app was geared to allow me to do that. When I had a feature that touched a certain area of the code, sending emails for example, this app would allow me to look up all Factoids that were tagged with 'email'. 

What is a factoid you may ask? Well the dictionary defines a factoid as being "*a brief or trivial item of news or information*". In the context of the above example, a factoid could be "Make sure to test sending email to an aol user, previously had issues with emails bouncing back." 

##Purpose
The main purpose of this app is learning. Nothing here is fully flushed out or in perfect working order. It is meant as a way for me to continue to learn about rails. Some of the things I am focusing on:

* ActiveRecord
* HAML
